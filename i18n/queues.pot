"Static agents are extensions that are assumed to always be on the queue.  "
"Static agents do not need to 'log in' to the queue, and cannot 'log out' of "
"the queue.<br><br>List extensions to ring, one per line.<br><br>You can "
"include an extension on a remote system, or an external number (Outbound "
"Routing must contain a valid route for external numbers). You can put a \","
"\" after the agent followed by a penalty value, see Asterisk documentation "
"concerning penalties.<br /><br /> An advanced mode has been added which "
"allows you to prefix an agent number with S, X, Z, D or A. This will force "
"the agent number to be dialed as an Asterisk device of type SIP, IAX2, ZAP, "
"DAHDi or Agent respectively. This mode is for advanced users and can cause "
"known issues in FreePBX as you are by-passing the normal dialplan. If your "
"'Agent Restrictions' are not set to 'Extension Only' you will have problems "
"with subsequent transfers to voicemail and other issues may also exist."

"in the queue tracking remote agents (agents who are a remote PSTN phone, "
